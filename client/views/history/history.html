                            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <strong>Bio Flex Industries</strong> moisture mitigation system was started out of a concern for moisture intrusion under vinyl flooring in hospital operating room floors. Flooring installation was problematic due to moisture and the formation of bacteria that would deteriorate the adhesives while creating a biosphere for microbial colonisation. <strong>Bio Flex Industries</strong> was originally the first moisture mitigation manufacturer of the most successful moisture mitigation system being sold today. The largest moisture mitigation companies in the USA and Germany still uses a close copy of the original <strong>Bio Flex Industries</strong> formula. <strong>Mr Epoxy LLC</strong> continues the progression of the original moisture mitigation formula by applying better science and experience to create our state of the art technology now available through <strong>Mr Epoxy’s Aqua Stop</strong>. The advantage of the latest technological advancement in <strong>Mr Epoxy’s Aqua Stop</strong> moisture mitigation system is the AMS system that controls atoms and prevents the hydrogen and oxygen ionic bond from forming into a problematic liquid or water.</p>
